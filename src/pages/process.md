## Process - From Thinking to Doing

![Discover insights from users, with stakeholders](../images/process/Empathize.png)

### Empathize

My design process starts with building an understanding of the domain, users, and stakeholders involved. By doing this, I can create hypotheses to test in the next part of the process.

By building an understanding, I can discover insights, uncover the unknown, and challenge assumptions made during my initial research.

See this project at [Bike Locker](/bikelocker).

An example of building understanding would be studying users going through their existing workflow that they use to fufill their goals. Uncovering the mechanisms of their workflow gives me a better understanding of where features can be expected to fit in their life.

### Define

From analysing the data from research, discussing with stakeholders such as project managers, I can start building a vision of what the problem space is and align on possible solutions with the rest of the team.

At this point it’s important to keep in mind the scope of the project and define a vision that is understood by all involved parties. Lots of discussion, lots of stickies, ultimately to meet inbetween user needs and business goals.

I believe in utilizing tools like journey maps and user personas which let me define the problem space for myself and other stakeholders. These tools to me are like the framing of a house, without them I’d have no structure to build upon.

### Ideate

Ideation involves exploring the problem space I just defined. Creating design artifacts, like feature lists and user flows, let me explore the touchpoints where my design will interact with end users.

I believe in making design artifacts to present the initial vision of the project to other designers, project managers, and developers. By bringing the trifecta together early, we can navigate issues that my design eye alone may not see.

An important lesson from [Jane Wong](https://medium.com/ssense-tech/designing-with-ambiguity-part-ii-design-doing-not-thinking-4065c07e7373) is to connect the dots but not all of them.

>“There were times we went down rabbit holes and lost sight of the bigger picture in a frenzy of ideas. This could unnecessarily draw out any ideation phase, when sometimes the best action is to sum up your findings and carry on in a direction.”

### Prototype - Testing

> Test early, test often

Prototyping to me is validating the ideas we’ve thought of and to start “thinking by doing”. Prototyping can be as quick as making paper prototypes, roughing out lightweight [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/)+[InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) mockups, or even making fully animated [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/ca/products/xd.html) prototypes. I make these to start checking if our ideas and assumptions are true for our end users.

From here I can refine, build, test, and repeat until the team or myself reach a stable conclusion that fits both business goals and user needs.

More time spent playing, testing, and iterating on concepts lets the team move forward with more decisiveness and clarity.

#### Role

At Visier Inc. I worked as a Junior User Experience Designer. My work was developing user workflows and prototyping interfaces for those workflows on the Workforce Analytics and Workforce Planning products. At Visier I got to apply user research practices and perform user tests in a variety of procedures from formal lab tests to [flexible](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/flexible-usability-testing/ "flexible") user testing. Due to Visier's audience mainly being [Human Resources](http://www.visier.com/customer-success/customers/ "Human Resources") professionals, performing user tests let me acquaint myself with Visier's user base and their needs.

#### Process

During my time as Visier, I worked between developers and the design team to complete projects as they came. I **produced** design documents that a developer group would review and iterate in order to realize what was possible and what was not within time or technological limitations. The final versions of prototypes would be presented to more senior developers and then to the company at the time in order to get feedback on the interface or interaction pattern.

#### Customer Support Portal

In the second half of my time at Visier I was tasked with helping start a customer portal service using the [Force.com](http://www.salesforce.com/ "Force.com") platform. I got to learn rudimentary knowledge of how to work within the Salesforce platform, and work with contractors to realize a taskflow that we wanted within the visual design of the customer portal. In this project I was in direct contact with the contracted services and was in partial management of these people in order to start the customer portal service on time. From this project I learned to **manage up**, as one of the managers said, which was to take charge of management when work slows down for various reasons.
